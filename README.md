# CVE-PULL
Python script to pull daily updated NVD CVE list and push into Slack Channel using webhooks.


### Introduction:
Most of the organisations are using Slack for getting alerts and also for monitoring purpose.
Everyday multiple CVEs publishes and it is difficult to keep the track in one place.
Nation Vulnerability Database publishes CVEs in json and thus we can leverage this functionality by python and getting alerts on slack.

Modify below mention parameter:
Enter webhook url : https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/TC0XXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXX


### Usage:

Python3 dailycvepull.py
OR
If you have zip file already downloaded then give the path
python3 dailycvepull.py https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/json/cve/1.0/nvdcve-1.0-recent.json.zip

### Slack WebHook:
- Create a Slack workplace to where alerts from NVD  will be sent to. Just visit  to https://slack.com/ and create channels with whatever name you want.
- Next, we need to generate Webhook URLs for the channel so that we can leverage Slack API.
- Browse to https://api.slack.com/apps and create a new application.
- Browse to Incoming Webhooks and create a Webhooks and which will give you a link by visiting Incoming Webhooks.
- You will obtain a link in the following format: https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/BF0XXXXME/XXXXXXXXXXXXX

Edit the python script and in 'self.url' enter the slack hook URL. Once youâ€™re done you can also add it to the cron job to automatically get the alerts everyday.


### Note:
It keeps data in buffer without downloading the file and uses some random cookies in script.
